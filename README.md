The code the experimental section in our IJCAI'12 paper "Robust Winners and Winner Determination Policies under Candidate Uncertainty" with  Craig Boutilier, Jerome Lang, and Hector Palacios.

The main algorithm implemented in the code is a variant of the C4.5 for finding optimal policies for finding the winning candidate, by constructing a decision tree for querying candidates for their availability, given a distribution of the sets of available candidates.
